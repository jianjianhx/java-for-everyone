# Chapter 13: Recursion

## 13.1 Triangle Numbers Revisited

1. Why is the statement else `if (width == 1) { return 1; }` in the final version of the `getArea` method unnecessary?

   Because it already has `if (width <= 0) { return 0; }`.
2. How would you modify the program to recursively compute the area of a square?

   You would compute the smaller area recursively, then return `smallerArea + width + width -1`
3. In some cultures, numbers containing the digit 8 are lucky numbers. What is wrong with the following method that tries to test whether a number is lucky?
   ```java
   public static boolean isLucky(int number) {
       int lastDigit = number % 10;
       if (lastDigit == 8) { return true; }
       else {
           return isLucky(number / 8);
       }    
   }
   ```

   You should add terminate condition `if (number == 0) { return false; }`.
4. In order to compute a power of two, you can take the next-lower power and double it. For example, if you want to compute $2^11$, and you know that $2^10 = 1024$, then $2^11 = 2 \times 1024 = 2048$. Write a recursive method `public static int pow2(int n)` that is based on this observation.

   ```java
   public static int pow2(int n) {
       if (n == 0) { return 1; }
       
       return 2 * pow2(n - 1);
   }
   ```
5. Consider the following recursive method:
   ```java
   public static int mystery(int n) {
       if (n <= 0) { return 0; }
       else {
           int smaller = n - 1;
           return mystery(smaller) + n * n;
       }
   }
   ```
   What is mystery(4)?

   `mystery(4)` is 1x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 + 4x4 = 30.

## 13.2 Problem Solving: Thinking Recursively

6. Consider the task of removing all punctuation marks from a string. How can we break the string into smaller strings that can be processed recursively?

   In this problem, any decomposition will work. We can remove the first or last character and then remove punctuation marks from the remainder. Or we can break the string in two substrings, and remove punctuation marks from each.
7. In a recursive method that removes all punctuation marks from a string, we decide to remove the last character, then recursively process the remainder. How do you combine the results?

   If the last character is a punctuation mark, then you simply return the shorter string with punctuation marks removed. Otherwise, reattach the last character to that result and return it.
8. How do you find solutions for the simplest inputs when removing punctuation marks from a string?

   The simplest input is the empty string. It contains no punctuation marks, so you simply return it.
9. Provide pseudocode for a recursive method that removes punctuation marks from a string, using the answers to Self Checks 6â€“8.

   ```java
   String removePunctuation(String str) {
       if (str.length() == 0) { return str; }
       else {
           char last = str.charAt(str.length() - 1);
           char last = Character.isLetter(last) ? last : '';
           return removePunctuation(str.substring(0, str.length() - 1)) + last;
       }
   }
   ```

## 13.3 Recursive Helper Method

10. Do we have to give the same name to both `isPalindrome` methods?

   No.
11. When does the recursive `isPalindrome` method stop calling itself?

   When `start` is greater than or equal to `end`.
12. To compute the sum of the values in an array, add the first value to the sum of the remaining values, computing recursively. Of course, it would be inefficient to set up and actual array of the remaining values. Which recursive helper method can solve the problem?

   int sum(int[] arr, int start, int end)`
13. How can you write a recursive method `public static void sum(int[] a)` without needing a helper function?

   Create new smaller arrays every time before calling the function recursively.
   
## 13.4 The Efficiency of Recursion

14. Is it faster to compute the triangle numbers recursively, as shown in Section 13.1, or is it faster to use a loop?

   The loop is slightly faster. It is even faster to simply compute `width * (width + 1) / 2`.
15. You can compute the factorial function either with a loop, using the definition that $n! = 1 \times 2 \times \ldots \times n$, or recursively, using the definition that $0! = 1$ and $n! = (n-1)! \times n$. Is the recursive approach inefficient in this case?

   No.
16. To compute the sum of the values in an array, you can split the array in the middle, recursively compute the sum of the halves, and add the results. Compare the performance of this algorithm with that of a loop that adds the values.

   The performance is about the same.
   
## 13.5 Permutations

17. What are all permutations of the four-letter word `beat`?

   `beat beta baet bate btea btae ebat ebta eabt eatb etba etab abet abte aebt aetb atbe ateb tbea tbae teba teab tabe taeb`
18. Our recursion of the permutation generator stops at the empty string. What simple modification would make the recursion stop at strings of 0 or 1?

   `if (word.length() <= 1) { permutationList.add(word); }`
19. Why isn't it easy to develop an iterative solution for the permutation generator?

   An iterative solution would have a loop whose body computes the next permutation from the previous ones. But there is no obvious mechanism for getting the next permutation. For example, if you already found permutations `eat, eta` and `aet`, it is not clear how you use that information to get the next permutation.
   
## 13.6 Mutual Recursion

20. What is the difference between a term and a factor? Why do we need both concepts?

   Factors are combined by multiplicative operators `*` and `/;` terms are combined by additive operators `+` and `-`. We need both so that multiplication can bind more strongly than addition.
21. Why does the expression evaluator use mutual recursion?

   To handle parenthesized expressions, such as `2+3*(4+5)`. The subexpression `4+5` is handled by a recursive call to `getExpressionValue`.
22. What happens if you try to evaluate the illegal expression `3+4*)5`? Specifically, which method throws an exception?

   The `Integer.parseInt` call in `getFactorValue` throws an exception when it is given the string.
   
## 13.7 Backtracking

23. Why does `j` begin at `i + 1` in the examine method?

   We want to check whether any queen[i] attacks any queen[j], but attacking is symmetric.
24. Continue tracing the four queens problem as shown in Figure 5. How many solutions are there with the first queen in position a2?

   One solution.
25. How many solutions are there altogether for the four queens problem?

   Two solutions.
